Add a Flipboard magazine widget (https://share.flipboard.com/) to your sidebar

== Description ==

Flipboard recently announced "Magazine Widgets" where you enter the URL of a magazine and it displays a "widget"
on your website.  This plugin allows turns this into a true WordPress widget.  All you have to do is enter the magazine's
URL, and this plugin handles the rest!  No need to worry about copying and pasting the Flipboard-generated code,
and the required JavaScript is handled in the appropriate WordPress way.

To get the URL of your magazine, you need to click the "Share" button on the cover of your magazine and
email that to yourself.  The URL that it generates is a short URL (http://flip.it/…).  Paste that into 
your browser, and the full-length URL that it converts to (https://flipboard.com/…) is the one that you 
enter in the widgets admin.

The magazine will not appear correctly if the visiting user is blocking JavaScript.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `flipboard-magazine-widget` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the widget to your sidebar, entering the magazine's URL in the "Magazine URL" field.
